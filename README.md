## Description 
The main objective of this project is to develop a single-page text editor that operates in the browser, meets PWA criteria, and functions offline. This application utilizes various data persistence techniques for browser compatibility and redundancy.

Starting with an existing app, this project integrates methods for retrieving and storing data to an `IndexedDB` database using `idb` -- a popular `IndexedDB API` wrapper used by corporations such as Google and Mozilla.

## Installation 
To install the program, you will need to have `VS Code` and `Node.js` installed. First, clone the repository. You will then need to install dependencies in order to use the application.

To use Text Editor, run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

This will install the necessary dependencies to utilize this application.

## Usage
This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) text editor, capable of storing data locally via `IndexedDB` and can be used offline if needed.
